# ePortfolio Github Page
### by Miguel CP Rodriguez IV 

Course: CS 499- Computer Science Capstone  

### Professional Self-Assessment:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of this ePortfolio has showcased several strengths as well as shaped some of my  values toward a career as a Junior Developer in the Computer Science industry. At the start of the initial development of the ePortfolio,  enhancement ideas and the progression toward the implementation of those ideas pressed the value of communication and its importance. Specifically, during the development of enhancement one ([cs330 milestone](https://github.com/migrodri1980/Working-portfolio-/tree/main/milestone%20cs330){:target="_blank"}) toward the implementation of an additional texture,  I engaged developer and professional based communities such as [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67607881/attempting-to-implement-a-second-texture-in-opengl){:target="_blank"} via posts for insight into this implementation. This communication coupled with research inspired me to further my understanding of many of the enhancements I was attempting to implement regarding data structures and algorithms implemented in Loginapplication.cpp. During the initial discussion of enhancement two([Loginapplication.cpp](https://github.com/migrodri1980/Working-portfolio-/blob/main/Loginapplication.cpp){:target="_blank"}), I had ideas toward implementing an array to hold user information and thus administrator functions such as creating, deleting, and updating a user. The communication and collaboration of the developer community once again led to me to research hash tables thus allowed me to understand their efficiency regarding smaller data sets as well as their limitations in larger data sets (hash collisions). This need for research, communication and collaboration furthered into enhancement three titled [LoginapplicationWSQL.cpp](https://github.com/migrodri1980/Working-portfolio-/blob/main/LoginapplicationWSQL.cpp){:target="_blank"}. Research into different database options such as SingleStore (as well as preforming test trials), allowed me to understand the differences and focuses of different database applications. Upon communication and collaboration with a few previous teachers and professional friends I was able to make an educated decision regarding the use of SQLite within my application. Communication with stakeholders was apparent in my communication with the development community regarding ideas toward enhancement implementation during my initial portfolio submission. Collaboration in a team environment came in the form of brainstorming with the development community regarding solutions toward the application of these enhancements. Upon this collaboration and further research, I was able to make decisions toward as well as create data structures such as the hash table implemented in Loginapplication.cpp to be utilized to perform the desired functionality. This value of collaboration and communication extended to LoginapplicationWSQL.cpp during the development of software engineering and databases in deciding how to implement the functionality within the application regarding customer information. Furthermore, the idea of security was present in user input validation in the form of “if” loop cin checks implemented throughout Loginapplication.cpp. Security continued to play a role in decisions regarding LoginapplicationWSQL.cpp as the principle of least privilege was implemented in the placement of insert and delete database functions being limited to the administrator menu. In summary, communication with stakeholders is key to the ability to collaborating within a team environment and is a value that has been strengthened during the development of this coursework which ultimately led to the software engineering decisions regarding creation and implementation of data structures, algorithms, database functionality, and security within the given projects displayed within this ePortfolio. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The portfolio provided is an introduction to my abilities and skills regarding computer science. Artifact one named [cs330 milestone](https://github.com/migrodri1980/Working-portfolio-/tree/main/milestone%20cs330){:target="_blank"} is meant to showcase my ability to create three dimensional objects within an OpenGL environment. This artifact is meant to show not only my ability in producing these objects, lighting, and scene but also display my current interest in art and its application in computer science. The implementation and understanding of a Vertex Array Object (VAO), Vertex Buffer Objects (VBO), and Element Buffer Objects (EBO) are visible within this application as well as the creation of fragment, light, and vertex shader source code. Artifact two named [Loginapplication.cpp](https://github.com/migrodri1980/Working-portfolio-/blob/main/Loginapplication.cpp){:target="_blank"} is meant to display my understanding of data structure creation and implementation within an application as well as also providing an example of my ability to implement algorithms to produce functionality utilizing those data structures. Furthermore, the choice of data structure as Hash Table was a decisive choice regarding the smaller data set in relation to time complexity. Lastly the final artifact named [LoginapplicationWSQL.cpp](https://github.com/migrodri1980/Working-portfolio-/blob/main/LoginapplicationWSQL.cpp) is a continuation of the previous artifact and incorporates the addition of an SQL database utilizing SQLite to serves storage of customer records. This artifact is meant to serve as an example of my understanding regarding not only the implementation of SQL databases but also my understanding of the command functions to implement SQL CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality within a C++ application. Below this assessment is a list of the artifacts as well as list of key elements in an effort to further explain skills and abilities that I am attempting to present within each project. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ePortfolio is meant to display not only my abilities as provided by the examples of the work within it but also to serve as a display of my understanding of the computer science field through the choices made throughout the individual artifacts. The skills and values that I have obtained and strengthened during this endeavor range from my ability to research, communicate, and address a problem with my peers as well as my persistence and determination to pursue a solution despite challenges. This can be seen in the implementation of this work provided within this ePortfolio. In conclusion, I appreciate your consideration and welcome all constructive criticsm to the projects created below.
